# freezing-2048

I'm learning react and I see IvanVergiliev's [2048-react](https://github.com/IvanVergiliev/2048-react), so I decided to write one too. It's freezing cold these days, so I named it freezing-2048.

I haven't add the animation effect yet.

### Usage

run: 

```
npm install -g node-static
static -p 8000
```

and open `localhost:8000`

develop:

```
npm install -g gulp
npm install
gulp
```
